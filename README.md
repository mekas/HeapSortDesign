# HeapSortDesign
1. Put your identity on top of this README
2. Create 2 directories: src and doc
3. Put your Project codes inside the src.
4. Under doc directory create another README.md. This is where you will create a summary of the report. 
5. Each of the experiment covers:
- Data Size = [10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, 10^7, 10^8]
- Each data case generating average case, best case, worst case. (Order don't matter but your output must signify which case currently running)
- Each number must be randomly generated between [0, 2^31]
6. Logging must covers the following:
- Size of the input
- Running step of HeapSort operation to validate the relation between input and output is indeed O(n log n) complexity. 
- Validation each data case generated are indeed average case, best case, worst case. You integrate this part to stdout to clarify.
7. Due time of this assignment is March 19th, 2025, 11:00 PM

# Report Summary (README.md under doc)
1. There are 3 section in the report: Data Generation, Complexity Report, and Self Reflection
2. In Data Generation, you explained the technical aspect regarding how you generate the data. 
3. In Complexity Report, create a table in MD format which have 3 headings: No,  input size, data case, output steps. 
- Data case covers which input case (worst/best/average)
- Your analysis about how the finding are this way
4. In Self Reflection, you give contemplation about the process, difficulties, and achievement of the current assignment.
